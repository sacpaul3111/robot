# Test 11: Services Validation - Working Explanation

## Test Information
- **Test Suite**: `test11_services_validation`
- **Robot File**: `services_validation.robot`
- **Test ID**: Test-11
- **Purpose**: Collect and document all running services on the target server for manual review

---

## Overview

Test 11 performs comprehensive service inventory and validation by:
1. SSH directly to the target server
2. Listing all system services using systemctl
3. Documenting service status to files for compliance review
4. Performing informational checks on required and unnecessary services

**Important Note**: This test is primarily for documentation and informational purposes. Service validation checks do not cause test failures; they document service states for manual review.

## Process Flow

### Step Model Structure
```
Step 1: Connect to Target
  └─> Establish SSH connection to target server

Step 2: Collect Service Data
  ├─> Step 2.1: Collect All Services Status
  └─> Step 2.2: Document Service Status to File

Step 3: Document Service Status (Informational)
  ├─> Step 3.1: Review Required Services Status (autofs, sshd, sssd, chronyd, ntpd, syslog)
  └─> Step 3.2: Review Unnecessary Services Status (iptables, selinux)

## Detailed Step-by-Step Working

### **STEP 1: Connect to Target Server** (Critical)
**Purpose**: Establish SSH connection

**Actions**:
1. Initialize with `Initialize Services Test Environment`
2. Establish SSH session
3. Verify connection active

**Success Criteria**: SSH connection verified

---

### **STEP 2: Collect Service Data**

#### **Step 2.1: Collect All Services Status** (Critical)
**Purpose**: List all system services and their statuses

**Actions**:
1. Execute `Collect All Services Status` keyword
2. Run SSH commands:
   - `systemctl list-units --type=service --all` - Get all services
   - `systemctl list-unit-files --type=service` - Get enabled services
3. Store in suite variables:
   - `${ALL_SERVICES_OUTPUT}` - Complete service list
   - `${ENABLED_SERVICES_OUTPUT}` - Enabled services list

**Data Collected**: Complete inventory of all system services

**Command Example**:
```bash
# List all services
systemctl list-units --type=service --all --no-pager

# List enabled services
systemctl list-unit-files --type=service --state=enabled --no-pager
```

---

#### **Step 2.2: Document Service Status to File** (Critical)
**Purpose**: Save complete service list to file

**Actions**:
1. Call `Save Services Status to File` keyword
2. Generate comprehensive service report with:
   - All services list
   - Enabled services
   - Active services
   - Failed services (if any)
   - Timestamp
3. Save to file: `service_status_<timestamp>.txt`
4. Verify file was created and has content

**Keywords Used**: `Save Services Status to File`

**Output File**: `results/test11_services_validation/data/service_status_<timestamp>.txt`

---

### **STEP 3: Document Service Status** (Informational)

#### **Step 3.1: Review Required Services Status** (Normal - Informational)
**Purpose**: Check status of required enterprise services

**Actions**:
1. Call `Validate Required Services Are Enabled` keyword
2. Check each required service:
   - **autofs** - Automounter for network file systems
   - **sshd** - SSH daemon
   - **sssd** - System Security Services Daemon (LDAP/AD integration)
   - **chronyd** - Time synchronization
   - **ntpd** - Alternative time synchronization
   - **rsyslog** / **syslog** - System logging
3. Document status of each service
4. Log findings (does NOT fail test)

**Pass Condition**: Service statuses are documented

**Note**: This is informational only - does not fail the test

---

#### **Step 3.2: Review Unnecessary Services Status** (Normal - Informational)
**Purpose**: Check services that should be disabled for security

**Actions**:
1. Call `Validate Unnecessary Services Are Disabled` keyword (continue on failure)
2. Check services that should be disabled:
   - **iptables** - Firewall (may be replaced by firewalld)
   - **selinux** - Security Enhanced Linux
3. Document status of each service
4. Log findings (does NOT fail test)

**Pass Condition**: Service statuses are documented

**Note**: This is informational only - documents findings for review

---

### **Additional Analysis Tests** (Normal)

#### **Service Dependency Analysis**
**Purpose**: Analyze service dependencies for critical services

**Actions**:
1. Execute `systemctl list-dependencies` for critical services:
   - sshd.service
   - chronyd.service
   - sssd.service
2. Log dependency trees (first 20 dependencies)

**Command Example**:
```bash
systemctl list-dependencies sshd.service | head -20
```

---

#### **Failed Services Report**
**Purpose**: Identify any failed services on the system

**Actions**:
1. Execute `systemctl --failed --no-pager --no-legend`
2. If failed services found:
   - Log failed services list
   - Save to file: `failed_services_<timestamp>.txt`
3. If no failed services:
   - Log "No failed services detected"

**Command Example**:
```bash
systemctl --failed --no-pager --no-legend
```

---

#### **Service Startup Time Analysis**
**Purpose**: Analyze boot time and service startup performance

**Actions**:
1. Execute `systemd-analyze time` - Get overall boot time
2. Execute `systemd-analyze blame | head -20` - Get 20 slowest services
3. Log boot time analysis
4. Identify services taking longest to start

**Command Example**:
```bash
# Get boot time
systemd-analyze time

# Get slowest services
systemd-analyze blame | head -20
```

---

#### **Security Services Status**
**Purpose**: Check security-related service configurations

**Actions**:
1. Check SELinux status: `getenforce`
2. Check iptables status: `systemctl is-active iptables`
3. Check firewalld status: `systemctl is-active firewalld`
4. Document findings without failing
5. Log security service statuses

**Command Examples**:
```bash
getenforce
systemctl is-active iptables
systemctl is-active firewalld
```

## Data Sources

### Input Data:
- Target server hostname and IP from command line
- SSH credentials

### Configuration Data:
Required services to check:
- autofs, sshd, sssd, chronyd, ntpd, rsyslog/syslog

Services that should be disabled:

## Common Issues and Troubleshooting

### Issue 1: Cannot Execute systemctl
**Symptom**: Step 2.1 fails with systemctl command not found
**Cause**: Target is not using systemd (older RHEL 6 or other init system)
**Resolution**: Test requires systemd-based Linux distributions

### Issue 2: Insufficient Privileges
**Symptom**: Some systemctl commands return permission denied
**Cause**: SSH user lacks privileges to query all services
**Resolution**: Use sudo or privileged account

### Issue 3: Required Service Not Found
**Symptom**: Service like chronyd or sssd not found
**Cause**: Service not installed on target system
**Resolution**: This is informational - document finding for manual review

## Understanding Service Statuses

### Service States:
- **active (running)** - Service is currently running
- **active (exited)** - One-time service completed successfully
- **inactive (dead)** - Service is stopped
- **failed** - Service failed to start or crashed
- **activating** - Service is starting up

### Service Enable States:
- **enabled** - Service starts automatically at boot
- **disabled** - Service does not start automatically
- **static** - Service cannot be enabled (started by dependencies)
- **masked** - Service is completely disabled and cannot be started
